Hello there! My name is Paulina Grunwald and I am self-taught software developer based in the Netherlands. I live in the Hague in the Netherlands. I created this blog to be able to share what I learn and discover in programming and self-development area. I learn from the community and love to share what I have discovered. I hang out on Twitter and would love to meet you!


__A little more about me…__ I am originally from Poland but lived abroad (Romania and Netherlands) for past 11 years. I’ve worked for in Oil&Gas sector for about 8 years and then made a career switch to software development. I’ve graduated of University of Bucharests’s Geological Engineering program where I obtained my Bachelor and Masters Degree. In 2016 I have decided to teach myself programming and in 2018 started working as full-time software developer. Currently I work as a software developer mostly focused on the frontend. I spend most of my time working with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and React. 


I’m __super passionate__ about software development and helping others that want to make a career switch to programming. 

When not creating websites, I love to spend my time hanging out with my family and friends, playing bass and doing photography.
